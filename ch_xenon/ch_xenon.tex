Blah blah blah. Remember Chapter~\ref{c.intro}? That was awesome.I am trying to write enough words so that I can figure out whether or not this paragraph is indented. I think it is, but I am not sure. How else could I figure out?

What about now? Is this indented now? It certainly should be.  This should be enough text to answer that question.  Thank you.
